            <h1>Organic Chemistry</h1>
            <p>A functional group is an atom or group of atoms responsible for the typical chemical reactions of a molecule.</p>

            <p> Distillation: The first step in oil refining. Since boiling points of molecules increase as molecular weight increases, separation is roughly in order of increasing numbers of carbon atoms per molecule. The crude oil mixture is heated, fractions turn into vapour, rise, condense and the liquid is collected. Usually the ‘fraction’ is still a mixture and requires further refining. </p>
                
            <p>Method of separating fractions in crude oil.
                1.	In a furnace, crude oil is heated until it turns into a vapour.
                2.	Vapours travel up through the fractionating column.
                3.	The vapour moves up from the hot bottom to the cooler top.
                4.	At different heights of the fractionating column, the gas liquifies at each of its levels.
                5.	Gas has a <20 degrees, Petrol 20 -70 degrees, Naphtha 70-160 degrees, Kerosene 160-250 degrees, Diesel 250-350 degrees, Bitumen >320 degrees </p>
                
            <p>A fraction is a group of hydrocarbons with a similar length chain. Similar length chain hydrocarbons have a similar boiling point. The longer the molecule, the stronger the intermolecular force, and will need more energy to turn the liquid into a gas.

                Fractional Distillation separates multiple fractions with similar boiling point
                Simple Distillation separates on mixture into two mixtures</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Carbon:</p>
<p>    •	Carbon’s bonding capacity = 4 </p>
<p>    •	Can form 4 covalent bonds</p>
<p>    •	There are 4 valence electrons</p>
<p>    •	Sharing 1 valence electron forms a covalent bond</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Saturated Hydrocarbons:</p>
<p>•	Saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons that contain only single bonds between carbon atoms</p>
<p>•	Simplest class of hydrocarbons</p>
<p>•	Each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. i.e. the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen</p>
<p>•	This makes them relatively unreactive, apart from their interaction with oxygen in the air in the case of combustion</p>

                Alkanes:
                •	The alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons
                •	Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with only single bonds between the carbon atoms
                •	Some can be arranged in continuous straight chains in a branched chain or a ring.

                Even if you have a L or C shape hydrocarbon, you still count the end carbon for the primary name.
                
                Nonane	C9H20			
                Decane	C10H22			
                
                General formula for alkanes
                Cn = H2n+2
                Isomers are organic molecules with the same molecular formula but a different structural formula
                Structural isomers have
                •	Different names
                •	Different chemical properties
                •	Different shapes
                Alkyl groups are types of functional group/attachments
                When working out the position of an alkyl group you start counting from the end that will give you the smallest number.
                If you have a double bond then you count from the closest end to the double bond.
                When naming isomers and its attachments, you name them in alphabetical order.
                Condensed Structural Formula
                2-methylpentane -> CH3CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3
                Physical Properties of alkanes -> Alkanes have low melting or boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces between the alkane molecules
                Viscosity: A measure of how resistant a fluid is to movement through it. 
                The more carbons, viscosity increases for alkanes
                Volatility: Is a measure of how readily a substance vaporizes or transitions from a liquid phase to a gas phase
                Chemical Properties:
                •	Alkanes are flammable and catch fire easily
                •	Complete or incomplete combustion
                
                Alkenes
                Alkenes make up a family of hydrocarbons that each contain one double bond between two carbon atoms. 
                They are unsaturated
                Prop-1-ene is WRONG, propene is correct, if the double bond is on the other side then it is the same name
                Alkenes are more reactive than alkanes due to the relatively instability of the double bond
                Breaking a carbon-carbon bond from a double bond between carbon atoms requires less energy than breaking a single C-C bond.
                The boiling and melting points of alkenes are generally slightly lower than alkanes with the same number of carbon atoms.
                The boiling point of straight-chain alkenes is more than branched-chain alkenes just as in alkenes.
                Combustion
                Oxygen + Hydrocarbon -> Carbon Dioxide + Water
                Propane is a hydrocarbon used in camping gas.
